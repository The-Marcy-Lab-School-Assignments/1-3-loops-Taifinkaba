# Question
Look at this `break` statement:

```js
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  if (i > 7) break;
  console.log(i)
}
```

Is there any way we could achieve the exact same functionality with a `for` loop, but *without* using the `break` statement?

# Answer
```js
for (let i = 0; i > 7 && i < 10; i++) {
  console.log(i);
};
```
This should get rid of the `break` function. Since the `if` statement only purpose was to hold `i > 7` I used `AND` to make it fit in the `for` loop.
