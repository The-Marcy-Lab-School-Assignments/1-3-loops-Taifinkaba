# Question
Look at this function:

```js
const bailOut = () => {
  for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    if (i > 3) return;
    console.log('Inside the loop', i);
  }
  console.log('Outside the loop');
};
```

Is that `console.log('Outside the loop');` ever going to run? Why or why not?

# Answer
No `console.log('Outside the loop');` will not run in this program because of the `if` statement which stops the code when `i > 3`. Code is  stopping at `i > 3` because when it is truthy it will exit the block of code and end the program.  The `return` statement exits the code from going through the entire code.

# Teacher Feedback

**There needs to be a bit more detail on why the code stops when `i > 3`. What is causing this stop? What keyword causes the function to end?**
